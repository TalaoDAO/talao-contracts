# Talao smart contracts

*If you are looking for the real code of the Talao token deployed in the mainnet ICO, please go here: https://github.com/TalaoDAO/talao-crowdsale. The token code is here as well but it's an updated version, just to get rid of warnings.*

## Credits

*Huge thanks to the awesome Ethereum community which provide us with great tools, Solidity code and inspiration. Special thanks to [OriginProtocol](https://www.originprotocol.com) for their implementation of ERC 725 and ERC 735, which we use with slight modifications.*
